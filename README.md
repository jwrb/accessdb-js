## accessdb-js library

ACCESSdb is a JavaScript library used to dynamically connect to and query locally available Microsoft Access database files within Internet Explorer.

This is a fork of the popular project from [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/accessdb/)
This version has been converted to use ACE OLEDB vs JET. Which was replaced and depreceated in Office 2007 and onwards.

It has been imported here and is unofficially maintained by [Joshua Baldwin](https://github.com/jwrb/)
